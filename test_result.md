# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency Platform - Implementation Progress

## Original Problem Statement
Building a production-grade blockchain-based supply chain transparency platform for agricultural produce that empowers farmers, distributors, retailers, consumers, and regulators to trace the journey of fresh produce from farm to store.

## Project Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, ShadCN UI
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Hardhat for local development
- **Storage**: Local file system for development

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Dependencies ✅
- [x] Create environment configuration files
- [x] Set up project structure
- [ ] Install and configure dependencies
- [ ] Set up database connection

### Phase 2: Backend API Implementation
- [ ] Complete user authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement batch management (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Integrate blockchain services
- [ ] File upload and QR code generation
- [ ] Audit logging system

### Phase 3: Smart Contract Development
- [ ] Deploy Hardhat local blockchain
- [ ] Implement SupplyChain smart contract
- [ ] Integration with backend services
- [ ] Testing blockchain functionality

### Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard Implementation
- [ ] Farmer dashboard (registration, produce input, QR generation)
- [ ] Distributor dashboard (inventory, purchasing, transfers)
- [ ] Retailer dashboard (purchasing, QR scanning, sales)
- [ ] Admin dashboard for oversight

### Phase 5: Testing and Integration
- [ ] Backend API testing
- [ ] Frontend functionality testing
- [ ] End-to-end system integration testing

## Testing Protocol
- **Backend Testing**: Use deep_testing_backend_v2 for comprehensive API testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Use auto_frontend_testing_agent for UI/UX validation
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete workflows from farmer to consumer

## Current Status
✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Environment setup and dependencies installed
- [x] Dependencies installed for both backend and frontend
- [x] Supabase integration configured and connected
- [x] Services running successfully (backend: port 8001, frontend: port 3000)
- [x] Frontend accessible at https://blockfarm-1.preview.emergentagent.com
- [x] Role-based UI with Farmer, Distributor, Retailer options visible

✅ **Currently Working**: 
- Backend server running with Supabase connection established
- Frontend showing AgriChain Tracker login/registration interface
- TypeScript compilation issues resolved

⚠️ **Next Required**: Database migration setup (tables need to be created in Supabase)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Set up Supabase database schema (manual migration needed)
2. 🔄 Complete user authentication and registration flow
3. 🔄 Implement role-specific dashboards
4. 🔄 Backend API implementation
5. 🔄 Smart contract development and integration
