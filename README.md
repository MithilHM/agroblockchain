Blockchain enabled Agriculture

Description: Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency Platform (Agricultural Produce)

This project delivers a production-grade backend for an agricultural supply chain transparency app using blockchain. It empowers all stakeholders—farmers, distributors, retailers, consumers, and regulators—to trace the journey of fresh produce from farm to store, verifying origin, pricing, quality, and preventing exploitation.

Key Features & Architecture:

Smart Contracts (Solidity/Ethereum): Immutable record of each batch (produce ID, origin, status, owner, price, transfer events), deployed on a public or permissioned blockchain.

Node.js/Express Backend (TypeScript): Bridges user-facing apps with blockchain and off-chain storage, exposing secure REST APIs for batch registration, ownership transfer, QR code generation, and batch lookup.

PostgreSQL Database: Stores off-chain metadata (user profiles, batch details, certificates, images, logs).

File Storage (AWS S3/IPFS): Handles bulky documents like inspection certificates and images, linking their hashes/URLs on-chain or in DB for verification.

QR Codes: Each produce batch gets a unique QR code, linking to full traceability info for fast, easy access at any stage (farmers via kiosk/app, consumers via scan at store).

Role-Based Authentication (JWT): Ensures security—only authorized users can register or transfer ownership.

APIs cover all major flows: /api/batch/register, /api/batch/transfer, /api/batch/:id, /api/user/register, /api/file/upload, /api/batch/:id/qrcode.

How it Works (Workflow Overview):

Farmer registers a new batch via app or kiosk; backend calls smart contract, generates QR, stores metadata.

Distributor/Retailer scans QR and transfers ownership, each action immutably recorded on-chain and in backend.

Consumer scans QR at purchase; app/API reveals step-by-step origin, pricing, and certification history.

Regulator can audit any batch’s digital paper trail, catching fraud or safety lapses.

All sensitive and large files kept off-chain for efficiency, but cryptographically linked to on-chain records.

Production Readiness:

Dockerized for easy deployment (cloud or low-cost hardware e.g., Raspberry Pi).

Audit-logs, error handling, and monitoring included.

DevOps pipelines recommended (CI/CD, auto-deploy).

Robust security, role management, and disaster recovery scripts provided.

Core Value:
End-to-end, user-friendly supply chain transparency, trusted by everyone—from village farmers to urban shoppers—enabled by modern blockchain and best software engineering practices.
